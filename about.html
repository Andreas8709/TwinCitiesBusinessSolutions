            <h1>Who We Are</h1>
            <p>Twin Cities Business Solutions was founded by a group of seasoned business analysts who saw firsthand how many companies struggled with inefficiencies and excess inventory. Early on, we worked with a large manufacturing client that was grappling with overstocked warehouses, tying up valuable capital and space. By implementing a data-driven inventory reduction strategy, we successfully reduced their inventory by 20%, freeing up significant resources and improving cash flow. This success not only solidified our passion for optimization but also inspired us to create solutions that help businesses streamline operations, reduce waste, and maximize profitability.</p>
